# BullyModMenu by zitrus2k
This is a simple Console based External ModMenu for the Game Bully:Scholarship Edition written in C++.

How to Set-Up:

1. Unzip the Archive
2. Start Bully
3. Run BullyModMenu.exe
4. 
Done!

Now you can choose between these Options in the Console:

1. Add $100
2. Substract $100
3. Max. Health
4. Kill (Is kinda broken, it only makes you onehit)

The .exe will probably be marked as a Trojan by the most Antiviruses, 
because it Reads and Manipulates other Applications Memory -
In this case Bully.exe
Just create a Exeption in your AV and it should work.

You can use this Code however you want, but Credit me @zitrus2k)!
