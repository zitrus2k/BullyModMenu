# BullyModMenu
This is a simple Console based External ModMenu for the Game Bully:Scholarship Edition written in C++.

How to Set-Up:

1. Start Bully
2. Run BullyModMenu.exe
Done!

Now you can choose between these Options in the Console:

1. Add $100
2. Substract $100
3. Max. Health
4. Kill (Is kinda broken, it only makes you onehit)

You can use this Code however you want, but Credit me @zitrus2k)!
