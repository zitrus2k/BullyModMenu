# BullyModMenu by zitrus2k
This is a simple Console based External ModMenu for the Game Bully:Scholarship Edition written in C++.

How to Set-Up:

1. Unzip the Archive
2. Start Bully
3. Run BullyModMenu.exe

Done!

Now you can choose between these Options in the Console:

1. Add $100
2. Substract $100
3. Max. Health
4. Remove Health
5. Godmode ON/OFF

The .exe will probably be marked as a Trojan by the most Antiviruses, 
because it Reads and Manipulates other Applications Memory -
In this case Bully.exe
Just create a Exeption in your AV or Compile the code yourself!

You can use this Code however you want, but Credit me @zitrus2k)!
